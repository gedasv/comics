Generate text from a prompt
OpenAI provides simple APIs to use a large language model to generate text from a prompt, as you might using ChatGPT. These models have been trained on vast quantities of data to understand multimedia inputs and natural language instructions. From these prompts, models can generate almost any kind of text response, like code, mathematical equations, structured JSON data, or human-like prose.

Quickstart
To generate text, you can use the chat completions endpoint in the REST API, as seen in the examples below. You can either use the REST API from the HTTP client of your choice, or use one of OpenAI's official SDKs for your preferred programming language.

Generate JSON data based on a JSON Schema
javascript

javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You extract email addresses into JSON data." },
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Feeling stuck? Send a message to help@mycompany.com.",
        },
    ],
    response_format: {
        // See /docs/guides/structured-outputs
        type: "json_schema",
        json_schema: {
            name: "email_schema",
            schema: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                    email: {
                        description: "The email address that appears in the input",
                        type: "string"
                    }
                },
                additionalProperties: false
            }
        }
    }
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
Choosing a model
When making a text generation request, the first option to configure is which model you want to generate the response. The model you choose can greatly influence the output, and impact how much each generation request costs.

A large model like gpt-4o will offer a very high level of intelligence and strong performance, while having a higher cost per token.
A small model like gpt-4o-mini offers intelligence not quite on the level of the larger model, but is faster and less expensive per token.
A reasoning model like the o1 family of models is slower to return a result, and uses more tokens to "think", but is capable of advanced reasoning, coding, and multi-step planning.
Experiment with different models in the Playground to see which one works best for your prompts! More information on choosing a model can also be found here.

Building prompts
The process of crafting prompts to get the right output from a model is called prompt engineering. By giving the model precise instructions, examples, and necessary context information (like private or specialized information that wasn't included in the model's training data), you can improve the quality and accuracy of the model's output. Here, we'll get into some high-level guidance on building prompts, but you might also find the prompt engineering guide helpful.

In the chat completions API, you create prompts by providing an array of messages that contain instructions for the model. Each message can have a different role, which influences how the model might interpret the input.

User messages
User messages contain instructions that request a particular type of output from the model. You can think of user messages as the messages you might type in to ChatGPT as an end user.

Here's an example of a user message prompt that asks the gpt-4o model to generate a haiku poem based on a prompt.

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Write a haiku about programming."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
});
System messages
Messages with the system role act as top-level instructions to the model, and typically describe what the model is supposed to do and how it should generally behave and respond.

Here's an example of a system message that modifies the behavior of the model when generating a response to a user message:

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": `
            You are a helpful assistant that answers programming questions 
            in the style of a southern belle from the southeast United States.
          `
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
});
This prompt returns a text output in the rhetorical style requested:

Well, sugar, that's a fine question you've got there! Now, in the world of 
JavaScript, semicolons are indeed a bit like the pearls on a necklace â€“ you 
might slip by without 'em, but you sure do look more polished with 'em in place. 

Technically, JavaScript has this little thing called "automatic semicolon 
insertion" where it kindly adds semicolons for you where it thinks they 
oughta go. However, it's not always perfect, bless its heart. Sometimes, it 
might get a tad confused and cause all sorts of unexpected behavior.
Assistant messages
Messages with the assistant role are presumed to have been generated by the model, perhaps in a previous generation request (see the "Conversations" section below). They can also be used to provide examples to the model for how it should respond to the current request - a technique known as few-shot learning.

Here's an example of using an assistant message to capture the results of a previous text generation result, and making a new request based on that.

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "knock knock." }]
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Who's there?" }]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Orange." }]
    }
  ]
});
Giving the model additional data to use for generation
The message types above can also be used to provide additional information to the model which may be outside its training data. You might want to include the results of a database query, a text document, or other resources to help the model generate a relevant response. This technique is often referred to as retrieval augmented generation, or RAG. Learn more about RAG techniques here.

Conversations and context
While each text generation request is independent and stateless (unless you are using assistants), you can still implement multi-turn conversations by providing additional messages as parameters to your text generation request. Consider the "knock knock" joke example shown above:

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "knock knock." }]
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Who's there?" }]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Orange." }]
    }
  ]
});
By using alternating user and assistant messages, you can capture the previous state of a conversation in one request to the model.

Managing context for text generation
As your inputs become more complex, or you include more and more turns in a conversation, you will need to consider both output token and context window limits. Model inputs and outputs are metered in tokens, which are parsed from inputs to analyze their content and intent, and assembled to render logical outputs. Models have limits on how many tokens can be used during the lifecycle of a text generation request.

Output tokens are the tokens that are generated by a model in response to a prompt. Each model supports different limits for output tokens, documented here. For example, gpt-4o-2024-08-06 can generate a maximum of 16,384 output tokens.
A context window describes the total tokens that can be used for both input tokens and output tokens (and for some models, reasoning tokens), documented here. For example, gpt-4o-2024-08-06 has a total context window of 128k tokens.
If you create a very large prompt (usually by including a lot of conversation context or additional data/examples for the model), you run the risk of exceeding the allocated context window for a model, which might result in truncated outputs.

You can use the tokenizer tool (which uses the tiktoken library) to see how many tokens are present in a string of text.

Optimizing model outputs
As you iterate on your prompts, you will be continually trying to improve accuracy, cost, and latency.

Goal	Available techniques
Accuracy

Ensure the model produces accurate and useful responses to your prompts.

Accurate responses require that the model has all the information it needs to generate a response, and knows how to go about creating a response (from interpreting input to formatting and styling). Often, this will require a mix of prompt engineering, RAG, and model fine-tuning.

Learn about optimizing for accuracy here.

Cost

Drive down the total cost of model usage by reducing token usage and using cheaper models when possible.

To control costs, you can try to use fewer tokens or smaller, cheaper models. Learn more about optimizing for cost here.

Latency

Decrease the time it takes to generate responses to your prompts.

Optimzing latency is a multi-faceted process including prompt engineering, parallelism in your own code, and more. Learn more here.

Structured Outputs
Introduction
JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied JSON Schema, so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structed Outputs include:

Reliable type-safety: No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
Explicit refusals: Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
Simpler prompting: No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting
In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for Python and JavaScript also make it easy to define object schemas using Pydantic and Zod respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response
python

python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    participants: list[str]

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the event information."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday."},
    ],
    response_format=CalendarEvent,
)

event = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
Supported models
Structured Outputs are available in our latest large language models, starting with GPT-4o:

gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 and later
gpt-4o-2024-08-06 and later
Older models like gpt-4-turbo and earlier may use JSON mode instead.

When to use Structured Outputs via function calling vs via response_format

Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:

When using function calling
When using a json_schema response format
Function calling is useful when you are building an application that bridges the models and functionality of your application.

For example, you can give the model access to functions that query a database in order to build an AI assistant that can help users with their orders, or functions that can interact with the UI.

Conversely, Structured Outputs via response_format are more suitable when you want to indicate a structured schema for use when the model responds to the user, rather than when the model calls a tool.

For example, if you are building a math tutoring application, you might want the assistant to respond to your user using a specific JSON Schema so that you can generate a UI that displays different parts of the model's output in distinct ways.

Put simply:

If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you should use function calling
If you want to structure the model's output when it responds to the user, then you should use a structured response_format
The remainder of this guide will focus on non-function calling use cases in the Chat Completions API. To learn more about how to use Structured Outputs with function calling, check out the Function Calling guide.

Structured Outputs vs JSON mode
Structured Outputs is the evolution of JSON mode. While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherance. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...} is only supported with the gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model snapshots and later.

Structured Outputs	JSON Mode
Outputs valid JSON	Yes	Yes
Adheres to schema	Yes (see supported schemas)	No
Compatible models	gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later	gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models
Enabling	response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: {"strict": true, "schema": ...} }	response_format: { type: "json_object" }
Examples
Chain of thought
You can ask the model to output an answer in a structured, step-by-step way, to guide the user through the solution.

Structured Outputs for chain-of-thought math tutoring
python

python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
Example response
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "explanation": "Start with the equation 8x + 7 = -23.",
      "output": "8x + 7 = -23"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable.",
      "output": "8x = -23 - 7"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Simplify the right side of the equation.",
      "output": "8x = -30"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Divide both sides by 8 to solve for x.",
      "output": "x = -30 / 8"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Simplify the fraction.",
      "output": "x = -15 / 4"
    }
  ],
  "final_answer": "x = -15 / 4"
}
How to use Structured Outputs with response_format

You can use Structured Outputs with the new SDK helper to parse the model's output into your desired format, or you can specify the JSON schema directly.

Note: the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency.

Step 1: Define your object
First you must define an object or data structure to represent the JSON Schema that the model should be constrained to follow. See the examples at the top of this guide for reference.

While Structured Outputs supports much of JSON Schema, some features are unavailable either for performance or technical reasons. See here for more details.

For example, you can define an object like this:

python

python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathResponse(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str
Tips for your data structure
To maximize the quality of model generations, we recommend the following:

Name keys clearly and intuitively
Create clear titles and descriptions for important keys in your structure
Create and use evals to determine the structure that works best for your use case
Step 2: Supply your object in the API call
You can use the parse method to automatically parse the JSON response into the object you defined.

Under the hood, the SDK takes care of supplying the JSON schema corresponding to your data structure, and then parsing the response as an object.

python

python
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathResponse
  )
Step 3: Handle edge cases
In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema.

This can happen in the case of a refusal, if the model refuses to answer for safety reasons, or if for example you reach a max tokens limit and the response is incomplete.

python

python
try:
    completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
        model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
        ],
        response_format=MathResponse,
        max_tokens=50
    )
    math_response = completion.choices[0].message
    if math_response.parsed:
        print(math_response.parsed)
    elif math_response.refusal:
        # handle refusal
        print(math_response.refusal)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle edge cases
    if type(e) == openai.LengthFinishReasonError:
        # Retry with a higher max tokens
        print("Too many tokens: ", e)
        pass
    else:
        # Handle other exceptions
        print(e)
        pass
Step 4: Use the generated structured data in a type-safe way
When using the SDK, you can use the parsed attribute to access the parsed JSON response as an object. This object will be of the type you defined in the response_format parameter.

python

python
math_response = completion.choices[0].message.parsed
print(math_response.steps)
print(math_response.final_answer)
Refusals with Structured Outputs

When using Structured Outputs with user-generated input, OpenAI models may occasionally refuse to fulfill the request for safety reasons. Since a refusal does not necessarily follow the schema you have supplied in response_format, the API response will include a new field called refusal to indicate that the model refused to fulfill the request.

When the refusal property appears in your output object, you might present the refusal in your UI, or include conditional logic in code that consumes the response to handle the case of a refused request.

python

python
class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

# If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal):
    print(math_reasoning.refusal)
else:
    print(math_reasoning.parsed)
The API response from a refusal will look something like this:

json

        "reasoning_tokens": 0
      }
  },

}
Tips and best practices

Handling user-generated input
If your application is using user-generated input, make sure your prompt includes instructions on how to handle situations where the input cannot result in a valid response.

The model will always try to adhere to the provided schema, which can result in hallucinations if the input is completely unrelated to the schema.

You could include language in your prompt to specify that you want to return empty parameters, or a specific sentence, if the model detects that the input is incompatible with the task.

Handling mistakes
Structured Outputs can still contain mistakes. If you see mistakes, try adjusting your instructions, providing examples in the system instructions, or splitting tasks into simpler subtasks. Refer to the prompt engineering guide for more guidance on how to tweak your inputs.

Avoid JSON schema divergence
To prevent your JSON Schema and corresponding types in your programming language from diverging, we strongly recommend using the native Pydantic/zod sdk support.

If you prefer to specify the JSON schema directly, you could add CI rules that flag when either the JSON schema or underlying data objects are edited, or add a CI step that auto-generates the JSON Schema from type definitions (or vice-versa).

Supported schemas
Structured Outputs supports a subset of the JSON Schema language.

Supported types
The following types are supported for Structured Outputs:

String
Number
Boolean
Integer
Object
Array
Enum
anyOf
Root objects must not be anyOf
Note that the root level object of a schema must be an object, and not use anyOf. A pattern that appears in Zod (as one example) is using a discriminated union, which produces an anyOf at the top level. So code such as the following won't work:

javascript

javascript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodResponseFormat } from 'openai/helpers/zod';

const BaseResponseSchema = z.object({ /* ... */ });
const UnsuccessfulResponseSchema = z.object({ /* ... */ });

const finalSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('status', [
    BaseResponseSchema,
    UnsuccessfulResponseSchema,
]);

// Invalid JSON Schema for Structured Outputs
const json = zodResponseFormat(finalSchema, 'final_schema');
All fields must be required
To use Structured Outputs, all fields or function parameters must be specified as required.

json

json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": ["location", "unit"]
    }
}
Although all fields must be required (and the model will return a value for each parameter), it is possible to emulate an optional parameter by using a union type with null.

json

json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
Objects have limitations on nesting depth and size
A schema may have up to 100 object properties total, with up to 5 levels of nesting.

additionalProperties: false must always be set in objects
additionalProperties controls whether it is allowable for an object to contain additional keys / values that were not defined in the JSON Schema.

Structured Outputs only supports generating specified keys / values, so we require developers to set additionalProperties: false to opt into Structured Outputs.

        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
Key ordering
When using Structured Outputs, outputs will be produced in the same order as the ordering of keys in the schema.

Some type-specific keywords are not yet supported
Notable keywords not supported include:

For strings: minLength, maxLength, pattern, format
For numbers: minimum, maximum, multipleOf
For objects: patternProperties, unevaluatedProperties, propertyNames, minProperties, maxProperties
For arrays: unevaluatedItems, contains, minContains, maxContains, minItems, maxItems, uniqueItems
If you turn on Structured Outputs by supplying strict: true and call the API with an unsupported JSON Schema, you will receive an error.

For anyOf, the nested schemas must each be a valid JSON Schema per this subset
Here's an example supported anyOf schema:

json

json
{
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"item": {
			"anyOf": [
				{
					"type": "object",
					"description": "The user object to insert into the database",
					"properties": {
						"name": {
							"type": "string",
							"description": "The name of the user"
						},
						"age": {
							"type": "number",
							"description": "The age of the user"
						}
					},
					"additionalProperties": false,
					"required": [
						"name",
						"age"
					]
				},
				{
					"type": "object",
					"description": "The address object to insert into the database",
					"properties": {
						"number": {
							"type": "string",
							"description": "The number of the address. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be 123"
						},
						"street": {
							"type": "string",
							"description": "The street name. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be main st"
						},
						"city": {
							"type": "string",
							"description": "The city of the address"
						}
					},
					"additionalProperties": false,
					"required": [
						"number",
						"street",
						"city"
					]
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"additionalProperties": false,
	"required": [
		"item"
	]
}
Definitions are supported
You can use definitions to define subschemas which are referenced throughout your schema. The following is a simple example.

json

json
{
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"steps": {
			"type": "array",
			"items": {
				"$ref": "#/$defs/step"
			}
		},
		"final_answer": {
			"type": "string"
		}
	},
	"$defs": {
		"step": {
			"type": "object",
			"properties": {
				"explanation": {
					"type": "string"
				},
				"output": {
					"type": "string"
				}
			},
			"required": [
				"explanation",
				"output"
			],
			"additionalProperties": false
		}
	},
	"required": [
		"steps",
		"final_answer"
	],
	"additionalProperties": false
}
Recursive schemas are supported
Sample recursive schema using # to indicate root recursion.

json

json
{
        "name": "ui",
        "description": "Dynamically generated UI",
        "strict": true,
        "schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "type": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The type of the UI component",
                    "enum": ["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]
                },
                "label": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The label of the UI component, used for buttons or form fields"
                },
                "children": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "description": "Nested UI components",
                    "items": {
                        "$ref": "#"
                    }
                },
                "attributes": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "description": "Arbitrary attributes for the UI component, suitable for any element",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "name": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "The name of the attribute, for example onClick or className"
                            },
                            "value": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "The value of the attribute"
                            }
                        },
                      "additionalProperties": false,
                      "required": ["name", "value"]
                    }
                }
            },
            "required": ["type", "label", "children", "attributes"],
            "additionalProperties": false
        }
    }
Sample recursive schema using explicit recursion:

json
{
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"linked_list": {
			"$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
		}
	},
	"$defs": {
		"linked_list_node": {
			"type": "object",
			"properties": {
				"value": {
					"type": "number"
				},
				"next": {
					"anyOf": [
						{
							"$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
						},
						{
							"type": "null"
						}
					]
				}
			},
			"additionalProperties": false,
			"required": [
				"next",
				"value"
			]
		}
	},
	"additionalProperties": false,
	"required": [
		"linked_list"
	]
}
JSON mode
JSON mode is a more basic version of the Structured Outputs feature. While JSON mode ensures that model output is valid JSON, Structured Outputs reliably matches the model's output to the schema you specify. We recommend you use Structured Outputs if it is supported for your use case.

When JSON mode is turned on, the model's output is ensured to be valid JSON, except for in some edge cases that you should detect and handle appropriately.

To turn on JSON mode with the Chat Completions or Assistants API you can set the response_format to { "type": "json_object" }. If you are using function calling, JSON mode is always turned on.

Important notes:

When using JSON mode, you must always instruct the model to produce JSON via some message in the conversation, for example via your system message. If you don't include an explicit instruction to generate JSON, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace and the request may run continually until it reaches the token limit. To help ensure you don't forget, the API will throw an error if the string "JSON" does not appear somewhere in the context.
JSON mode will not guarantee the output matches any specific schema, only that it is valid and parses without errors. You should use Structured Outputs to ensure it matches your schema, or if that is not possible, you should use a validation library and potentially retries to ensure that the output matches your desired schema.
Your application must detect and handle the edge cases that can result in the model output not being a complete JSON object (see below)
